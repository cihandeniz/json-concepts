Assume that you develop a web based software in which there is a board where people can post photos and view photos of others. This software will likely to have;</p><ul><li>UI aspect: a UI app to post and browse photos</li><li>API aspect: an API that handles photo posting and listing</li><li>DevOps aspect: a CI mechanism to manage deployments</li></ul><p>For every aspect of this software, there are different concepts. For example;</p><ul><li>From a UI aspect, there are routing concepts</li><li>From an API aspect, there are endpoint concepts</li><li>From a DevOps aspect, there are deployment concepts</li></ul><p><strong>json concepts</strong> can help you to define these concepts. Using your concept definitions you can create and validate schemas for every aspect. These schemas will have certain things in common, for example a routing schema may differ for each environment. So environment is a concept for UI aspect as well. This means transforming a schema from one aspect into another may also help you to organize your source code.</p><p>For now this section includes a couple of use cases that represent the motivation behind developing <strong>json concepts</strong>. As it finds more real life usage, we will add more examples.</p><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-use-case" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anatomy-of-a-use-case" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Anatomy of a Use Case</h2><p>Each use case follows below structure;</p><ul><li>Problem definition</li><li>Short example of the problem</li><li>A solution using <strong>json concepts</strong></li><li>A solution without <strong>json concepts</strong></li></ul>',10);function s(n,i){return a}var l=o(t,[["render",s]]);export{l as default};
